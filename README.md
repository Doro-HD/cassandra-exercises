# How to use this repository
Each exercise is split into it's own package/folder. An exercise contains an solution and a starting template for you 
to use. Each exercise contains it's own README.md file that is meant to guide you through the exercise.

I highly recommend that you set your editor to view .md files in preview mode, otherwise you might see the hints.
